LogCatch
===
Log viewer for Linux/Mac/Windows.
First desigend for android adb logcat viewer.
Now you can use this for general log viewer by easy filtering and highlighting.
This is written in tcl/tk.

Spec:
- Colored log. logtype detection is supported. like time threadtime brief process, and eclipse copied, studio copied logs. 
- Filtering by keywords. This is done by awk regular expression like awk '/key|word/ {print}'
- Searching keyword and highlighting it.
- Saving log.
- Can read saved logs in a file.
- View adb logcat logs from a device.

## Requirements
You need to prepare commands: wish, gawk, and adb(for android).

### Linux:
gawk for filtering, tk package for GUI, and android-sdk for adb.

### Mac:
android-sdk for adb, and gawk.

### Windows:
bash, wish, gawk, android-sdk for adb.

I recommed to install msys-git. This contains git, bash, awk, wish.

No warranty for subsystem-linux on windows 10. Only mysy-git is supported.

## Install
### Linux:
Arch:
`pacman -S --needed gawk tk android-tools`

Debian/Ubuntu:
`apt-get install gawk tk android-tools`


### Mac:
`prepare android-sdk`

`brew install gawk`

### Windows:
I tested my-app on msysgit enviroment.

Install from : [here](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)

Or active tcl may work().
